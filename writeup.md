## Format

This project is the public-facing website of the Ministry of Colonization, a department of an unnamed government of Martian settlers who began launching Von Neumann probes to human-habitable worlds sometime in the early 2070s. Like most such government websites, it tries to educate the public about its mission: replicating humanity across the galaxy, while subtly trying to justify its budget allocation. Its pages should, I hope, be self-explanatory.

You can access the website at: [ministryofcolonization.netlify.app](https://www.ministryofcolonization.netlify.app]). 

## Context

All events and research that the website mentions after 2020 are part of a possible reality in which humans are, quite probably, alone in the universe, and where all of today's open questions in scientific fields like astrophysics and biology, as well as technological fields like AI and nanotech, resolve in humanity's favor, i.e. we will be more likely to be the first inhabitants of the whole galaxy and the bottleneck is behind us. In this reality, 

- Musk's Mars colonization plans succeeded without a hitch, and Mars has over ten million inhabitants and an independent government by 2070. 
- AI and nanotechnology continued to improve after 2020, to the point where dog-like intelligences are common and matter fabricators like those in Neal Stephenson's *The Diamond Age* produce free food and basic materials for anyone. 
- Governments are already openly planning to abolish work by 2080, as artificial general intelligence becomes just around the corner. 
- Improvements to laser focusing and mass production mean that laser sailing is now orders of magnitude cheaper than in 2020. Powerful lasers are still out of the financial reach of everyone but governments and megacorporations, and heavily export controlled like missiles or nuclear reactors are today, but laser transmission of power and laser-powered intra-Solar System transit is *de rigueur*.
- Despite consequences of climate change that sadly I think are unavoidable at this point - massive refugee crises in Southeast Asia and countless wars over water - humanity survived both ~600ppm CO2 and a limited nuclear exchange between China and India, albeit at tremendous human cost.

At this point, the technologies to make Von Neumann probes are cheap enough that state-level actors can choose to create them for as much as Earth's space program costs today. I chose Mars as the hypothetical creator of Von Neumann probes, since few other states or corporations would have any incentive to spend large portions of their budget on creating civilizations they cannot control and will only exist thousands of years after they die, but a Martian state was nominally founded out of existential risk concerns for humanity and gains significant propaganda value in the near term from galactic colonization.

## Connection to UChicago BPRO 288: Fossils to Fermi Paradox

All the scientific "discoveries" mentioned that date after 2020 are the most plausible resolutions I could think of to some of the open questions discussed in UChicago's Big Problems: Fossils to Fermi Paradox course, and those before are real. Lecture by lecture:

### Astronomy

See *Why colonize?*

- **Lecture 6 on planetary formation**: Mars is able to send arbitrary amounts of Von Neumann probes to Mars-like planets because, as mentioned in lecture, most stars have at least one of them. There are many candidate worlds to inhabit, and much potential life that can exist there. 
- **Lecture 8 on exoplanet climate:** Prof. Abbot mentioned that if future telescopes could tell us the temperature and composition of alien atmospheres, we could tell if the carbon cycle worked the same way it does on Earth. Here, Earth is an exception, and most planets either draw too much carbon into the ground or too little.

## Biology

Unfortunately, I believe that given eukaryotic life, intelligent life was bound to evolve, so few opportunities exist here to fudge calculations in humanity's favor.  As a result, complex life here necessarily rarely if ever comes into being. However, I did mention some implications of biology here:

- **Lecture 2 on the tree of life:** We know little on the origin of life, but here, the tree stops before it can even begin. Most of the complexity of life occurred dependent on one single development - eukaryotic life - which has never been repeated.
- **Lecture 4 on bird intelligence:** This is the reason for the MoC's dictum that all planets with eukaryotes will be left untouched (in Q&A): if birds developed the precursors to civilization - speech, toolmaking, and cooperation - independently, technological intelligence is certainly common here on Earth.
